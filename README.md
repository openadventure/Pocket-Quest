Open Adventure - Pocket Quest ![pocket quest logo][PQlogo]
==================

The revolutionary **Open Adventure** rules condensed into a single sheet
of paper (printed duplex). The entire game (including equipment, magic,
game master rules, etc.) can be played with six sheets of rules total.
**Pocket Quest** aims to allow for OA to be played when few resources,
time or rules are available.

Develop
==================
**Pocket Quest** is an open source, free-to-play RPG system that is similar in play-style as [B/X][bx] but can play both fantasy and sci-fi games (anywhere from [LOTR][lotr] or [D&D][dnd] to [Star Wars][sw] or [Star Trek][st]).

We want to re-light the lost flame of old school gaming in a new way. Instead of recreating a wheel that's already been made, we have set out to bring modern day techniques and mechanics to the games of old. Help discuss and develop the game by offering your own ideas, art and homemade rules. Together, we can all create a game we love to play!

If this project has captured your imagination, or you find yourself wanting to know more, then we suggest you continue by reading the [Introduction][intro] page, which details an overview of what OA is, what it stands for and what software and expertise you'll need to start contributing today!
